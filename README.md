# Regex Tutorial: Hex Value Matching
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful patterns used to match character combinations in strings. In this tutorial, we'll delve into the regex components that match hex values.

# Summary
Hexadecimal coding ensures precision and consistency in electronic displays. A six-digit number preceding the # symbol represents a color in hexadecimal. Example: /^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/

# Anchors

Anchors align positions before, after, or between characters. ^ matches the string's initial character, and $ matches the final character.
# Quantifiers

Quantifiers express the expected number of characters. They default to being greedy but can be modified with ?. Example: {6} for six characters and {3} for three characters.
# OR Operator

The | element signifies the "or" operator. In our hex value regex, it separates two possible formats: [a-f0-9]{6} or [a-f0-9]{3}.
# Character Classes

Character classes provide character type information. In our example, [a-f0-9] looks for hexadecimal digits (0-9, a-f).
# Bracket Expressions

Bracket expressions match any character within square brackets. Example: gra[ae]y matches both "gray" and "grey."
# Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy matches as many times as possible, while lazy matches as infrequently as feasible. The lazy quantifier ? in our example ensures the fewest possible occurrences.
